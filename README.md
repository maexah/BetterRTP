## Libraries
BetterRTP uses and is compiled with the following libraries:

- [PaperLib](https://github.com/PaperMC/PaperLib) (included) - Library for interfacing with PaperMC specific APIs, used for async chunk loading.
- [FoliaLib](https://github.com/TechnicallyCoded/FoliaLib) (included) - Library for interfacing with Folia specific APIs, used for cross-platform timers.

## Build instructions on Ubuntu

```bash
mvn clean install
```

By default the project compiles with the classic `-source`/`-target` flags so it
works on whichever JDK you already have installed (even ones that do not support
the `--release` option).  If you want to emit a specific bytecode level, pass a
release flag such as `-Dmaven.compiler.release=17` or
`-Dmaven.compiler.release=21` to the Maven command above.

The built JAR will be placed in the `target/` directory.
